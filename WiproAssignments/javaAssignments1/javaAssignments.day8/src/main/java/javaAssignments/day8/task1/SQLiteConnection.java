/* Task 1: Establishing Database Connections
Write a Java program that connects to a SQLite database and prints out the connection object to confirm successful connection. */

/* Step-by-Step Implementation

    Add SQLite JDBC Dependency:
        If youâ€™re using Maven, add the following dependency to your pom.xml:
        
    Explanation :

    DriverManager.getConnection(url): This method attempts to establish a connection to the given database URL. Here, sample.db is the name of the SQLite database file. If the file does not exist, SQLite will create it.
    connection: This variable holds the connection object, which is printed to confirm the successful connection.
    try-with-resources: In the finally block, the connection is closed to release database resources properly. In a real-world scenario, you might want to use a try-with-resources statement to handle this automatically.*/
