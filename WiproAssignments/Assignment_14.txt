//Write a script that reads numbers from the user until they enter '0'. The script should also print whether each number is odd or even.

Bash Script:

#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    read -p "Enter a number (0 to stop): " number
    if [ "$number" -eq 0 ]; then
        break
    fi

    if [ $((number % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "$number is even"
    else
        echo "$number is odd"
    fi
done

Explanation of Bash Script:

1The 'read' command takes input from the user.
2 '-eq' checks for numerical equality.
3 '$((expression))' evaluates arithmetic expressions.
4 '%' is used for the modulus operation to determine if a number is even or odd.
